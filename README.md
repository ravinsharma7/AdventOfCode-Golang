# AdventOfCode-Golang
AoC 2024

# Introduction "Dialog Engineering"
- The approach is as an idiot I can breakdown the concept part by part until chatgpt guides me to the correct answer.
- Compared to prompt engineering, where you create "fancy structured text" mindlessly to make the output follow a particular pattern or topic.
- I'm not going to do any fancy structuring of my text to chatgpt. Just applying "Socratic Method In Action" with the AI.
- My goal is not jump directly to a correct using chatGPT, but dance towards the correct answer. Is that what they called as RAG if you brute force the dance?(Ah whatever)
- Using golang code for 2 reasons. First golang has barely changed syntax over the decade. Second golang has probably one the best backward compatibility among the popular languages.(and only like 25 keywords, i think). Given this two factors, I'm guessing chatgpt should have a better result.
- Model used 4o

# Results
- Mad that ChatGPT can generate the code for the correct answer. I'm commiting the right answer from chatgpt for reference later. See how it goes.

### Day 1
- Part 1 First try: Correct
  - Direct Paste of Question+Input. No additional text aside appending "Generate go code" 
- Part 2 First try: Correct  
  - Direct Paste of Question+Input. No additional text. But in the same chat window.

### Day 2
- Part 1 First try: Correct  
  - Direct Paste of Question+Input. No additional text. But in the same chat window.
- Part 2 First try: Correct
